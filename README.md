🤖 Agentic AI Overview
Agentic AI refers to a new generation of artificial intelligence systems that can act autonomously, set goals, and make decisions without constant human input. These systems are designed to function more like intelligent agents, capable of planning, adapting, and executing complex tasks over time.

📌 What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI systems go beyond traditional reactive AI models. Instead of merely responding to inputs, they operate with a sense of agency—the ability to initiate actions based on objectives, adapt strategies, and learn from feedback in real-time.

🧠 Key Features
🔁 Autonomy: Performs tasks with minimal or no human intervention.
🎯 Goal-Oriented: Acts to achieve long-term objectives.
🧩 Adaptive Planning: Adjusts plans based on changing environments or results.
🧠 Decision-Making: Uses reasoning to choose optimal actions.
🌐 Environment Interaction: Observes and responds to external inputs dynamically.
✅ Examples of Agentic AI
1. Auto-GPT
A powerful agent that takes a user-defined goal and autonomously performs tasks to achieve it—like researching, writing, and deploying.

2. BabyAGI
A task-driven agent that continuously generates, prioritizes, and executes tasks to meet a high-level goal.

3. Devin (by Cognition Labs)
The first AI software engineer that can understand software requirements, write and debug code, and push changes to production.
