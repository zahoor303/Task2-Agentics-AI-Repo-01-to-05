What is Swarm?

Swarm is an experimental framework by OpenAI to help developers build systems where multiple AI agents work together like a team to solve complex tasks.

It focuses on being:

* Lightweight (easy to use)
* Ergonomic (developer-friendly)
* Flexible (easy to test and scale)

 Key Concepts of Swarm

1. Agents
An Agent is like a team member trained to do one specific job using tools and instructions.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
In a customer support system:

* One agent handles technical questions.
* Another handles billing issues.
* Another answers general queries.

Each agent is specialized and focuses only on its own task.


 2. Handoffs
A Handoff means passing a task from one agent to another whoâ€™s better suited to handle it.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
If the general query agent gets a message about a refund, it can **handoff** the task to the billing agent who knows how to handle refund requests.


 Why Use Swarm?

* Breaks big problems into smaller parts
* Lets agents cooperate and specialize
* Makes it easy to test and build complex AI systems


 Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a hospital:

* A nurse checks symptoms (Agent 1)
* A doctor makes the diagnosis (Agent 2)
* A pharmacist gives medicine (Agent 3)

If the nurse sees something serious, she hands off the patient to the doctor. Thatâ€™s exactly how Swarm works â€” AI agents hand off tasks to each other.
